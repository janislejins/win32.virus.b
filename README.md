### Win32.Conficker.A (2008-current) 

**2016**

Janis Lejins (B.1992),

*The Conficker virus has been one of the most difficult to eradicate as the author (or authors) frequently update it so that it can evade antivirus measures. It also makes use of encryption stronger than military grade to hinder tampering and make analysis difficult. A colletion of high profile tech companies including Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, and ICANN have formed a working group to deal with the virus. The virus patches the vulnerabilities that previous variants used and listens for other infected machines on other computers and and updates them to the latest version. Only variant E (the most recent) actually uses the system to do something other than infect other computers - it sends spam emails. Variant E also deletes itself and leaves a copy of the D variant on the system. Microsoft posted a USD$250,000 bounty for information leading to the author. Thia bounty remains uncollected, the author remains unknown and known infected systems still number in the hundreds of thousands and the damges are in excess of $9.1 billion US*
