**Virus procured by mad computer scientist Gareth Dunstone (1990)**

#### Linux.Wirenet (2012)
*The linux variant of the wirenet trojan, also comes in windows and OSX variants*  
*Steals passwords from browsers and takes screenshots and sends the data to this server: 212.7.208.65*
*Uses an encrypted configuration to prevent reverse engineering.*

#### Win32.FileCoder/Cryptowall (2015-current)
*Encrypts your files, and ransoms them for Bitcoins.*
*A+ Terrifying.*
*Cryptolocker variants are dreaded so much because there is no way (short of being the NSA) of getting encrypted files back, hence why a significant number of people pay up.*
*The ransom cost increases at timepoints to encourage rapid payment.*
*Version 4.0 uses P2P encrypted anonymising networks to connect to its command and control server and uses AES coupled with RSA algorithms to encrypt the victims files.*

#### Win32.CodeRed.A (2001)
**USD$2.6b**

*This worm infected over 359,000 computers, mostly infecting web servers as it exploited a vulnerability in web server software.*
*It would send a long string of letters to a web server until it "overflowed" out of the safe area and executed the commands asked.*
*This worm was used to launch attacks on many ip addresses when triggered, including ip address of the White House web server.*

#### Win32.ILOVEYOU Love Letter Worm (2000)
**USD$8.7b**

*One of the earliest, seriously damaging computer worms.*
*It successfully attacked tens of millions of windows systems. It overwrote random files and emailed itself to all the addresses in the Windows Address Book.*
*Because these emails camer from recognised addresses and people were more likely to click the file and infect their systems.*

#### Win32.Klez.A (2001)
**USD$19.8b**

*This worm exploits Internet Explorers HTML renderer in Microsoft Outlook an Express, and hence was spread through email.*

### Win32.MyDoom.AA (2004-2009)
**USD$43.9b**

*MyDoom holds the record for fastest spreading computer worm.*
*It performed a DDoS on the infrastructure of controversial company "The SCO Group", presumably for the companies unethical software patent trolling of the open source software community. Later versions also targeted the Microsoft website and blocked anti-malware sites.*
*Its intended purpose is only functional in an estimated 25% of the systems it infects.*

### Win32.NetSky.B (2004)
**USD$2.0b**

*NetSky is another prolific computer worm like Win32.MyDoom and was written by the same author as Win32.Sasser.*
*This particular variant (Netsky.B) actually deleted MyDoom and Bagle worms.*

### Win32.Sasser.B (2004) 
**USD$18.1b**

*This worm spread virulently through a vulnerable port on Windows XP and Windows 2000.*
*Some variants have been known to delete other worms.*

### Win32.StuxNet (2010)
*This worm was used to infect a very specific target: SCADA Windows computers with Programmable Logic Controllers, and was used to target the centrifuges in nuclear power plants in Iran, this caused the centrifuges to shake themselves apart.*
*Stuxnet is believed by some to have been developed by US Government bodies in coalition with Israeli Government, however this remains controversial.*

### Win32.Zbot Zeus/Zeus Gameover (2007, 2013)
*This intercepts credit card information entered into a browser, gathers extensive private information (such as Bitcoin wallets and website logins) and uses the system to perform clickfraud.*
*It also allows many other data collection features, allows an attacker to install a Bitcoin miner and is a frequent vector for ransomware installation.*
*It operates using custom encrypted peer to peer updates, while also using a distributed Command and Control server architecture.*
*This is one of the first instances of malware being developed exclusively for sale and is thought to originate in Russia. Packages can be bought for as little 6 Bitcoins rising up to 43 Bitcoins, and botnets created are frequently rented out on a neccesity basis.*

### Win32.Conficker.A (2008-current) 
**USD$9.1b and counting**

*The Conficker virus has been one of the most difficult to eradicate as authors seem to be frequently updating it so that it can evade antivirus measures and it makes use of encryption stronger than military grade to hinder tampering and make analysis difficult.*
*It has been so difficult to eraticate that a colletion of high profile tech companies including Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, and ICANN have formed a working group to deal with the virus.*
*The virus uses P2P commuinication and a variety of exploits to gain infection. It patches the vulnerabilities that previous variants used and listens for other infected machines attempting to exploit the system and updates them to the latest version when they do, as well as allowing more recent versions access.*
*Only variant E (the most recent) actually uses the system to do something other than infect other computers, it uses the system to send spam. Variant E also deletes itself and leaves a copy of the D variant on the system.*
*Microsoft posted a USD$250,000 bounty for information leading to the author.*
*The bounty remains uncollected, the author remains unknown and known infected systems still number in the hundreds of thousands.*
